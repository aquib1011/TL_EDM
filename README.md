**Smart manufacturing with transfer learning under limited data: Towards Data-Driven Intelligences**

This study throws light on developing a new prediction model using
transfer learning (TL) to predict the material removal rate (MRR) of the electrical discharge
machining (EDM) process. The input parameters are pulse on time, current,
and voltage. The developed model is based on Deep Neural Network (DNN). The
proposed method overcomes the limitations of traditional machine learning (ML)
models, which require many experimental datasets for accurately predicting the responses. The results show that transfer learning (TL) can be used to
overcome the issue of limited data in the manufacturing process.

**Keywords:** Transfer learning, Deep Neural Network, Electrical Discharge Machining, Material Removal Rate, Smart Manufacturing

**Installation**

The code is written in Python 3.8.6. The following libraries are required to run the code beyond the Python's standard libraries:
	```python
	 pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

**Usage**
Run *TL_EDM.ipynb* in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
